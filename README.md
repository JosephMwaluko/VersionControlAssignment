# VersionControlAssignment
First, I created the file hello.txt
Secondly, I added the first line of text to it using the echo - cat command.
Then  I created a branch called "feature." I added the hello.txt file to it and added a second statement at the end of the exsisting content in the file.
After that I commited the changes, merged them with the main and pushed it to the remote repository.
3 commits were made in the whole process.

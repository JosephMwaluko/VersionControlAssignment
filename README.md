# VersionControlAssignment
First, I created the file hello.txt
Secondly, I added the first line of text using the echo-cat command.
Then,  I made a branch called "feature." I added the hello.txt file to it and added a second statement at the end of the existing content in the file.
After that, I committed the changes, merged them with the main and pushed them to the remote repository.
Four commits were made in the whole process.
